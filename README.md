# PitcherFamilies
A python program which uses data scraped from various baseball data sites and performs clustering in order to categorize pitchers into "families".  The data used includes the physical characteristics of the pitcher's fastball, breaking balls and off-speed pitches as well as the pitcher's characteristic outcomes such as groundball/flyball percentages, walks-to-strikeouts ratio, whiff rates and more.
